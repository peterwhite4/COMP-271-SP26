    "\n",
    "Coming into this course requires familiarity with the following **core programming skills:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrays** (lists, in Python)  \n",
    "  [Practice on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/v1e7rvrd/) during the winter break, email Leo for assistance.\n",
    "- **Loops**  \n",
    "  [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for),  \n",
    "  [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while)\n",
    "- **Conditionals**  \n",
    "  [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if)\n",
    "- **Strings**  \n",
    "  [Practice on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/v1ei9bm1/)  during the winter break, email Leo for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be comfortable working in a **programming environment**. If you have not yet committed to one, I recommend  \n",
    "[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code can be run:\n",
    "- **Natively** on your own computer, or\n",
    "- **Virtually** via **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides a cloud-based development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a central platform in the broader computing community, and creating a free account is strongly recommended. If you sign up using your `@luc.edu` email address, your account will automatically be upgraded to a higher tier at no cost to you. We'll review GitHub and Codespaces during our first week of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two **important resources** that you should bookmark and visit frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html), and\n",
    "- [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing your way around these two resources is one of the best things you can learn about the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also download, print, and study the [Programmer's Pact](./ProgrammerPact_Python_2026.pdf). This is a single page document that specifies how your code has to be written. The rationale behind the pact is explained, with examples, in [this notebook](./ProgrammerPactAnalysis.ipynb). Please read it carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, programming in general—and data structures in particular—requires a reasonable level of comfort with **algebra and calculus**. Mathematics is the *science* in *computer science*. You should review material from **COMP 163**, especially basic notation and symbolic reasoning, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **number sets**  \n",
    "  $\\mathbb N$, $\\mathbb R$, and subset notation, for example $\\mathbb R_{<0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **function declarations**  \n",
    "  $f:\\mathbb N\\rightarrow \\mathbb R$\\\n",
    "  Suggested reading: \n",
    "- **quantifiers**  \n",
    "  $\\exists$, $\\forall$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **set membership**  \n",
    "  $c\\in\\mathbb R_{>0}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **simple set operations and relations**  \n",
    "  $\\cup$, $\\cap$, $\\times$, $\\subset$, $\\supset$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **important functions**  \n",
    "  $\\log_2n$, $e^n$, $n!$, $\\binom{n}{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit of effort, you should be able to read, decode, and understand expressions such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&\\text{Let } f,g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}. \\\\\n",
