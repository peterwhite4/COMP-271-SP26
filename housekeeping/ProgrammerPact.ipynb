    "# Why is the Pact important?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Programmer’s Pact is a set of rules designed to promote readability, consistency, and long-term maintainability of code. The Pact is a deliberately abbreviated and pragmatic subset of PEP 8, the primary style guide for writing Python code. Style guides matter because they establish shared conventions that allow code to be understood, maintained, and extended by others—often long after the original author has moved on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely accepted principle in software engineering is that code is read far more often than it is written—an idea closely associated with Donald Knuth, Martin Fowler, and Guido van Rossum. Readability is therefore not cosmetic; it is foundational. Style guides support readability by setting clear expectations about naming, structure, and layout, so readers know where to look, what to expect, and how to interpret what they see.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary reason for enforcing the Pact in my courses is practical. Consistent style makes it easier to distinguish carefully written student work from rushed, copied, or automatically generated code. Submissions that substantially violate the Pact often indicate a lack of engagement with the assignment and, in some cases, raise concerns about academic integrity."
