    "## Isomorphic Strings (LC 205)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two strings, `s` and `t`, of the same length. Your task is to determine whether the two strings are **isomorphic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two strings are **isomorphic** if you can replace each character in `s` with another character to obtain `t`, following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each character in `s` must always map to the **same** character in `t`.\n",
    "2. Different characters in `s` must map to **different** characters in `t`.\n",
    "3. A character is allowed to map to itself.\n",
    "4. The order of characters must remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the characters of `s` and the characters of `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  s = \"egg\", t = \"add\"\n",
    "Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `'e'` maps to `'a'`\n",
    "- `'g'` maps to `'d'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying these mappings to `\"egg\"` produces `\"add\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  s = \"foo\", t = \"bar\"\n",
    "Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `'f'` maps to `'b'`\n",
    "- `'o'` would need to map to both `'a'` and `'r'`, which is not allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  s = \"paper\", t = \"title\"\n",
    "Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Each character in `s` maps consistently to a unique character in `t`.\n",

    "- Both `s` and `t` consist of letter characters only.\n",

    "A Python function named `are_isomorphic` that returns `True` if the two strings are isomorphic and `False` otherwise, plus any additional functions you deem necessary.

    "## Interleaving Strings (LC 97)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given three strings: `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. Your task is to determine whether `s3` can be formed by **interleaving** the characters of `s1` and `s2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interleaving** of two strings means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All characters from `s1` and `s2` must appear in `s3`.\n",
    "- The **relative order** of characters from `s1` must be preserved.\n",
    "- The **relative order** of characters from `s2` must be preserved.\n",
    "- Characters from `s1` and `s2` may be mixed together, but you may not reorder characters within either string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, `s3` is formed by weaving together the characters of `s1` and `s2` while keeping each string’s internal order intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  s1 = \"aabcc\", s2 = \"dbbca\", s3 = \"aadbbcbcac\"\n",
    "Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "One valid interleaving is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take characters from `s1`: `aa`  \n",
    "- Then from `s2`: `dbbc`  \n",
    "- Then from `s1`: `bc`  \n",
    "- Then from `s2`: `a`  \n",
    "- Then from `s1`: `c`\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces `\"aadbbcbcac\"`, which matches `s3`.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  s1 = \"aabcc\", s2 = \"dbbca\", s3 = \"aadbbbaccc\"\n",
    "Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "There is no way to interleave `s1` and `s2` while preserving the order of both strings to obtain `s3`.\n",
